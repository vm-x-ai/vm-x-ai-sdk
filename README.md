# VM-X AI

VM-X is a routing and management layer for AI.

Common questions our users face are:

- How do I **reduce my inference cost** and increase model performance?
- **Which models are best** for my use case, and what providers should I run them on?
- How can I manage **AI resource use** across my different applications, teams, processes so that high priority tasks always get executed?
- How does model performance vary across providers? Is this provider/model **robust and reliable** enough to build my application on?
- What **security measures** can I deploy across my model infrastructure?

This is where VM-X comes in. It simplifies the management of AI models, enabling you to manage allocation, routing, fallback, and security of AI workloads.
